        \subsection{What is a modern computer?}
        Computer is a synchronous, sequential, digital, electronic machine. Wow,
        that's a lot of words, what they mean tho? tldr:
        \begin{enumerate}
                \item {\bf electronic} means that it works on electricity
                \item {\bf digital} means that it interprets ranges of voltage
                        as logical states. In other words if you give it idk at
                        least 3.3 volts it treats it as logical true or a 1, it
                        does not care about the value itself.
                \item {\bf sequential} means that it has capability of
                        remembering results of what was done previously and
                        based on that it may change its behaviour.
                \item {\bf synchronous} means that it has a clock somewhere
                        inside and all its actions are conducted in-tempo with
                        this clock.
        \end{enumerate}
        It's all such a massive simplification that my digital electronics prof
        would kill me if he read this, don't show it to him. It gets the point
        across tho.

        In practice a computer is a collection of different hardware pieces that
        work together to perform certain operations and talk with the user each
        of them is so ridiculously complex that no one person understands them
        all on a truly deep level. Let's go through some of them in a relaxed,
        short fashion just to make sure we at least know what they do.
